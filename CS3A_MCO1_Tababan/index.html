        <h1>The Beginning of My Life</h1>
        <p>First and foremost I am joebert and this is the stories and events that happened in my 21 years of
          existence. Let’s start at the beginning of all events that I can reminisce about the events of the past.
          I was born in a small town called Casilagan Sta. Cruz where people are all connected, by their
          names and they are all somehow my relatives. When I was just a baby, according to my father I was
          stamped on the head by a goose or a duck when I was sleeping at our house. That was the most
          remarkable thing that had happened during my infant days. My mother once told me that I was a kid
          that will always be sick at any time, so that is when my mother said a joke to me “when you are just
          a kid you will always get sick and have fever, so we have to go to the health care center. You are
          just like a son of a wealthy family because you are always ill”. My mother created my childhood
          which means that she was the one who I am with, because my father works in different places to
          sustain our needs. With that being said that my mother is always there with me, it was also the start
          of my punishment days where I was always hit by anything that my mother would get on her hands
          just like a walis tambo, kaldero, and firewood. After she hits me with those, my skin will look dark,
          so her reaction will be. Tell me she's sorry because I was too naughty, that is why she was so angry
          at that time, she explains every reason why she did it in the first place. As a kid I will just nod my
          head and also cry, but I understand her reasons. I did not plant any hard feelings on my mother, I
          admit that as a kid I am a bit naughty. There was once a time when my mother would say to me that I
          need to sleep to get taller and if I did not follow what she had said I would get punished. Again, as a
          kid I will do anything to go outside and play, it was an afternoon when I was required to sleep and
          my mother was right by my side sleeping and I told her that I needed to take a poo. Because our
          comfort room was outside our house I will go out and take a poo, so that was my time to execute
          my plan to not really take a poo, rather take a playtime with friends, however I did not know that my
          mother was really just behind me and I thought I really did it but, I was wrong because she’s just
          beside me and after I looked back I saw her with a stick in her hands, I knew I will get smacked by
          that stick. There was once in a lifetime that I pooped in my pants because the bus that we were
          waiting for a long time did not arrive at the right time. So my pants feels weird when the bus arrived,
          I told my mother that I pooped in my pants and gave me a slight pinch on my belly and did not
          board that bus. We looked for any source of water so that my mother would be able to wash me.
          After some rinsing, my mother let me walk in a place full of people, without any clothes on my lower
          body. Until we found a store that sells some clothes that I may wear, so my mother bought me
          clothes to wear.<br><br>
</p>
          <h1>Family Problem</h1><br>
<p>
          To begin with, I’ll give some background about my mother. My mother’s name is Raquel, and my
          father was her second husband. They were married around 2008-2012 they were married at a mass
          wedding in a nearby catholic church. They were so happy together, I saw them kiss after the priest
          said so, there were gifts and stuff after the wedding. However, life wasn’t as they had planned,
          because my mother always had some issues in their relationship with my father. Because of
          financial problems, and other specific reasons. Then one time my mother was furious about
          something to my father, then I was the one who received her anger when she saw me crying
          because I cannot understand what they are fighting for, she told me to get out of the house and told
          me to stay there, it was in the middle of the night when that happened. It lasted for more than a
          minute until my father was able to tell me to get in and sleep inside. That was not just the time I
          have encountered that event in my life, in what I recall, my parents are arguing at something when
          all of a sudden, my mother ran and reached for the knife that was putted on the window, after
          reaching for the knife my father hold my mother to stop my mother from harming anyone, when my
          mother was hold onto place my father told me to call my grandpa and tell him what was going on,
          my mother then said “if you call your grandpa I will kill your father” when I heard that I was frozen
          in place and did not know what will be my next step. Until I felt that something was off between my
          parents. There was a day when my mother told me to prepare and we will stroll in the nearby city.
          After that, we boarded a bus to go there, but to my surprise there’s this random man that sat beside
          us with my mother. And all of a sudden, my mother and that guy talked to each other, where they
          looked like they had known each other for a long time. After some time we arrived at our destination
          and my mother told me to speak nothing about what I saw and I should keep it a secret. Then we
          proceeded to a fastfood restaurant to have some food. The guys talked to me at that time saying
          something to get my attention. And after that interaction my mother and I headed home, I did not
          spoked a single word to my father, not any. Then that was the time when, my mother suddenly told
          me that she has to go to Manila and find a job and will not be able to go home for a long time. I said
          “okay”, I did really know what was happening at that time but was not affected by it. My mother then
          disappeared and was nowhere to be found, so my father’s natural reaction would be, search for my
          mother and bring her back to our house. But my father failed to find my mother. After failing to find
          my mother, someone told my father that they saw my mother with another man on a bus heading to
          manila.

<h1>The New Beginning</h1>
<p>

            But first I will introduce you to my father who took all the burden that my mother had left us. My
            father is a hardworking person , he is a farmer and second to the last to his siblings. Our life
            continued without my mother, my father will have to live without my mother. There were times
            where he was introduced by some of his friends to some girls from different places. But all of them
            were not meant for my father, so he stayed single for a long time. When I was in grade three we left
            our hometown, where my father works. He was a caretaker of an old woman who was the mother of
            his brother’s wife. We stayed there for a year, so I studied there for my third grade. My father and I
            would go to a nearby mall to stroll and unwind. My father would treat me to arcade games and walk
            around the mall and enjoy our time together. After some time the old woman that my father was
            taking care of was angry any time of the day. We endured it for a period of time, until I told my father
            that we should go back to the province and live there. So that is when we packed our things and
            head to our home in the province. When we got back to the province my friends would laugh at me,
            because I talk in tagalog because the language that was spoken, on where we came from was
            tagalog. So then we continued our lives living in the province.\
            </p>
            <h1>High School Days</h1>
            <p>
              After my elementary my uncle told me to study in a private school and he will pay all my bills, it is
              not that a big of a school but it was still a private school. So, I did go in that school. Within that
              school, it is where I got my scar that I will have to carry for the period of my life. It was a lunch
              break when, my classmates and schoolmates agreed to play outside the vicinity of the school, a
              court nearby our school. We were just playing basketball when all of a sudden the enemy player
              rushed the ball in offense mode to shoot the ball in the basket, I was the one who was tasked to
              defend our basket, so he jumpfaked me, which my reaction was to jump. That’s when I felt my wrist
              feels numb, and to my surprise after seeing what had happen was I laugh it out. Not knowing the
              consequence of what had happen during that time. So my seniors carried me to the school and one
              of our instructor at that time, given me first aid. He putted two hard flat sheets on both sides of my
              arm and tightly taped it so that it applies pressure to the my broken wrist. After that, my father was
              called so that they will bring me to the hospital. When the ambulance arrived at our school, I was
              carried inside the ambulance. It was my first time, riding an ambulance, I was rushed to the hospital
              like my status is worse, but it was not that kind of worse. People are looking at me as I was rushed
              at the hospital, I can hear the siren go up as we go on our way. After I arrived at the hospital I was
              ask some questions by the nurse and they evaluated my state. After some days of waiting they told
              me to go OR so that they can start the operation. My operation was successful and after some
              procedures, I was discharge from the hospital.
              After grade seven, I transferred to Olongapo where my uncle lives. They asked me to study there
              and I did go with them. So the rest of my highschool days were spent in Olongapo. My first days
              there were uncomfortable as I needed to adjust myself because my father is far from me. I cannot
              sleep at night when I am alone in a room, so I told my uncle that I cannot sleep when I’m alone, so
              my uncle decided to sleep beside me to help me sleep at night and that only lasted a week for me to
              adjust. After some time I was able to sleep at night without needing someone to sleep right beside My uncle and his wife are both teachers in the same school where I study. One of them is a TLE
              teacher and the other one is an agriculture teacher. So we go to school at the same time, with their
              car. But before we enter the school we need to get some canteen supplies at the market, because
              my TLE aunt is the one that manages the canteen. So we buy supplies and go to school. In the
              morning I am tasked to help sell some of the food they serve at the canteen, and in the afternoon I
              have to attend my class and smelling like a mixed smell of food, so I always seat at the back alone
              because I can smell myself and I am shy to seat beside my classmates because I smell. That was
              my everyday strugle at school, not only at school, because after school my clothes will have to be
              washed, my clothes stinks everytime I put them into the washing machine as it absorbed the odor
              of the canteen. Even if it was washed and dried it still has the smell of food in it so, I will have to
              wear them and distance my self from my classmates. That cycled for a long time, not until my aunt
              retired from teaching, I was able to enter the school vicinity without smelling like a mixed smell of
              food in the canteen. That is when I started to develop some confidence and socialize with my other
              classmates. I got a top 10 at our section, I was very happy when I heard my name, because it was
              my first time being in a top 10 achievers. I was so proud of myself.

              <h1>Pandemic Days</h1>
              <p>

                Pandemic was right before we move up to senior high school, the awaited moment was of our life
                was cancelled because of the pandemic. We were asked to stay at home and have our moving up
                ceremony online. So we did not walk on stage to experience those kind of things. After moving up
                from high-school to senior high, it was the time to look for a school for senior high. The school that
                I choosed was the columban college inc. I tooked their entrance exam for TVL-ICT and passed, so
                then it begins. It was the time of pandemic where lot of people were infected by the corona virus,
                that led the school let us have our education at our home, we were given modules to answer and
                read. I read and answered all the modules but having some difficulties solvin problem from one of
                my subject where you have to self study to be able to answer some problems. In mid pandemic era,
                one of the family member was infected with the virus, she was diagnosed positive in the said virus.
                She needed to be isolated in a room where nobody must be in contact with her, but I was the one
                that gives her food from time to time. I was not worried about the virus being transmitted to me, but
                then, I later felt and observed that I have signs of the covid. So that day I was also put in an
                isolation room and have to wait for my healing progress. It took me two weeks to recover from it,
                but no doctor said I was positive. After two years of senior high school, finally the graduation day.
                Graduation day was just a simple day that was celebrated with pizza and drinks. And also marks the
                near end of the pandemic era.</p>
                <h1>Back to Ilocos</h1>
                <p>

                  After graduation I said to my self that I wanted a new and better life, so I told my uncle that I am
                  studying in Ilocos for my college. They did not like my desicions, because life here in Ilocos is hard,
                  because no one can help me sustain my school needs. However I still insisted in going to ilocos.
                  Because, pandemic impacted my life so much that my health is affected and even my mental status.
                  I needed to breakfree from it so I decided to go to Ilocos and study here for college. And now, no
                  regret was put inside me as I was happy in what I haved decided. That was the entirity of my whole
                  life. Thank you so much for reading this biography of mine.</p>
