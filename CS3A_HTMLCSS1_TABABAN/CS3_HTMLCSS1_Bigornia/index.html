<h3>Top Jobs to take</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>Software Developer
        <dd>On why i would take "Game Developer" as a job is because i want to create games that will make a lot of gamers happy.
        Being a Game Developer is a tough job because if i walk the path of being an indie developer it will be harder to create games because i will be the only person developing the games and managing the codes but if i make it into a corporation i will probably be exploited for my work.
        Being a game developer will take a lot of me, but i will tough it out because in my head i know that i took this job because i love developing games.

    <dt>Graphic Designer
        <dd>Why i would take "Graphic Designer" as a job is because of my artistic passion to design and create logos and draw beautiful things.
            Being a Graphic Designer is a tough job because the market is already full of graphic designer making it tough for new aspriring graphic designers.
        Still maybe i would still pursue graphic designeing as a job so that i could hone my skills more

    <dt>Web Developer
        <dd>Why i would take "Web Development" as a job is because it is the most simpliest developer job that is on the market as it is.
            Since this job is the most simpliest for developers it is also full on the market making it hard to apply for job like this.
            It is still a job i would take because not only is it simple to do but also more fun the only problem for this are graphic designers creating complex art making it miserable to do.
